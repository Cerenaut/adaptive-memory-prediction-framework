This site exists to support a paper titled "Generating Adaptive Behaviour within a Memory-Prediction Framework", that can be found here:

The next step will be a detailed analysis of an improved algorithm exploring hierarchies scaled up to between 10 and 100 units. The analysis will again include some demonstrations, much more impressive this time! 

ETA of the next code+paper is March 2012. Again, the code will be uploaded here once the demos are complete.
